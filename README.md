# Cleaning and Analyzing Crime Data Project

## Objective
In this project, we aim to clean and analyze a real-world dataset containing crime data from 2020 to the present. The goal is to prepare the dataset for analysis, perform exploratory data analysis, and answer specific questions related to crime trends, patterns, and factors influencing crime rates.

## Dataset
We will be using the Crime dataset from this link https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present

## Tasks
1. **Data Acquisition:**
   - Download the dataset from the provided link and load it into your preferred data analysis tool.

2. **Data Inspection:**
   - Display the first few rows of the dataset.
   - Check the data types of each column.
   - Review column names and descriptions, if available.

3. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Identify and handle missing data appropriately.
   - Check for and remove duplicate rows.
   - Convert data types if needed (e.g., dates to date format, numerical values to appropriate numeric types).
   - Deal with outliers if relevant to your analysis.
   - Standardize or normalize numerical data as necessary.
   - Encode categorical data if present.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualize overall crime trends from 2020 to the present year.
   - Analyze and visualize seasonal patterns in crime data.
   - Identify the most common type of crime and its trends over time.
   - Investigate if there are any notable differences in crime rates between regions or cities.
   - Explore correlations between economic factors (if available) and crime rates.
   - Analyze the relationship between the day of the week and the frequency of certain types of crimes.
   - Investigate any impact of major events or policy changes on crime rates.

5. **Advanced Analysis (Optional):**
   - Use predictive modeling techniques (e.g., time series forecasting) to predict future crime trends.
   - Explore additional questions or hypotheses related to the dataset.

## Usage
